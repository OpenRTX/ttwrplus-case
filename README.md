This case gives an ergonomic body to the Open Source board. It wen't through more than 10 iterations to get the most out of the design, focusing on ease of use and creation via 3Dprinting. It cost 0.5-1.5â‚¬/$ and approximately 3-5 hours to produce. 

The recomended printing settings are:
 - Filament tested are PLA (more ridig, harder snap-on, risk of buttons breaking) and PETG (more flexible and durable, weaker snap-on)
 - Layer Height between 0.1 - 0.15 - 0.2mm
 - 4 perimiters
 - No Support
 - No infill
 - All model are already placed correctly for optimal printing
 - If you struggle with bed adhesion and/or warping on the edges, use Brim of 3-5mm


You also have the option to have the text printed in another material, directly fused with the main case.

To try this more advanced (and risk prone) effect follow these steps:

![Open TEXT file in slicer](https://github.com/OpenRTX/ttwrplus-case/assets/49025042/9791871d-1376-4efe-a389-2dd8654a8385)
1 _ Open in your slicer of choice (here PrusaSlicer) the TEXT version of the .stl file;
2_ Dont move the model on the bed surface;

3_ Slice it in your filament of choice and save it as gcode;

4_ Remove the model from the slicer, and open the Case .stl file, without moving it;

5_ Slice it in your filament of choice and save it as gcode;

6_ Print it as you normally would with a filament different from what you want to use in the main case;

7_ When the print is complete, Remove Skirt if you used one and possible impurities on the bed surface without removing the bed surface;

8_ Unload the filament and reload the new filament you want for the Case, removing blobs and impurities from the nozzle;
